libpcap-latency-meter
=================

Java-based tool to measure latency between inbound and outbound TCP packets (for example, FIX protocol messages).

See github wiki for more information.

December 2025 Update: [I made a much better tool](https://github.com/epam/ebpf-fix-latency-tool) for the same purpose!
